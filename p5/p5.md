No code needed for this one. It's a small-scale LCM problem, and will probably be faster to do by hand.

- $1 = 1^1$
- $2 = 2^1$
- $3 = 3^1$
- $4 = 2^2$
- $5 = 5^1$
- $6 = 2 * 3$
- $7 = 7^1$
- $8 = 2^3$
- $9 = 3^2$
- $10 = 2 * 5$
- $11 = 11^1$
- $12 = 3 * 2^2$
- $13 = 13^1$
- $14 = 2 * 7$
- $15 = 3 * 5$
- $16 = 2^4$
- $17 = 17^1$
- $18 = 2 * 3^2$
- $19 = 19^1$
- $20 = 2^2 * 5$

$LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560$
